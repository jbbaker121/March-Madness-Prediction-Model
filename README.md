# March-Madness-Prediction-Model

I created this March Madness model on a Google Sheets spreadsheet when I was 12 years old. Since 2022, it has outperformed the average bracket by 41% on average.

2022: Scored 99, average 57 (74% outperformance)
2023: Scored 55, average 43 (28% outperformance)
2024: Scored 92, average 63 (46% outperformance)
2025: Scored 101, average 87 (16% outperformance)

This model incorporates the most important factors when choosing a championship team: rebounding, strength of schedule, offensive and defensive efficiency, and shooting numbers.
